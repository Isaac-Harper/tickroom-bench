// The room this deployment measures: tickroom's own `examples/pong/sim.ts`,
// carried over as the stamped reference simulation and changed in four places,
// all of them because this app is a MEASUREMENT rig rather than a game.
//
// Read the library's copy for the contract itself: idempotent join, a pure
// tick, a serialize/deserialize pair that genuinely round-trips, seeded
// randomness that survives a checkpoint, everything off the wire clamped inside
// the simulation, and events handed back to the host. None of that is different
// here. What follows is only what changed, and why.
//
// 1. `SEATS` IS 20, NOT 2. The number being measured is a POPULATED room:
//    `bytesDelivered` is `bytesPublished * players`, the per-socket subscriber
//    fan-out is what a managed Redis plan bills, and a two-seat table can show
//    neither. It also lets every bench client sit in ONE room instead of being
//    scattered across instances by the balancer, which would measure something
//    else. Sides alternate by arrival order so both ends fill evenly.
//
// 2. A WIN NO LONGER PARKS THE ROOM. The example sets `winner` and returns
//    early from every subsequent tick, which is right for a game and fatal for
//    a twelve minute unattended run: the ball stops, and a stopped ball reads
//    to the analysis as a room full of zero-motion frames. Here a win is
//    announced, held for `WIN_PAUSE_TICKS`, and then the scores reset and play
//    resumes. The `win` event still fires exactly once per match.
//
// 3. THERE IS A `marker` ENTITY, and it is the whole reason this file is worth
//    reading. See the comment on `MARKER_SPEED`.
//
// 4. THE RUNTIME IS A FACTORY TAKING AN INSTANCE ID, which rides every
//    snapshot. See `createPongRuntime`.

/**
 * THE CONSTANT-VELOCITY ENTITY THE WHOLE MEASUREMENT HANGS OFF, at exactly the

 *
 * Everything in this room that moves is a bad ruler. The ball bounces, so a
 * rendered step against it is negative for perfectly correct reasons and
 * "backward steps" stops meaning anything. A paddle clamps at the field edge
 * and stops, so "zero-motion frames" stops meaning anything. The library's
 * `tests/helpers/smoothness.ts` measures a `bot` travelling at a constant
 * 100 u/s for exactly that reason: EVERY deviation a client renders then
 * belongs to the network path and to nothing else, so a backward step is a
 * rewind, a zero-motion frame is a stall, and a peak above 100 is jitter being
 * replayed as motion.
 *
 * This is that entity, at that speed, on Vercel. It is what makes a number off
 * this deployment comparable to the loopback number the README already
 * publishes, which is the entire point of the exercise.
 *
 * IT NEVER WRAPS AND IT IS CHECKPOINTED, both on purpose. A wrap would put a
 * legitimate discontinuity in the one signal that exists to have none, and
 * leaving it out of the checkpoint would put one at every ticker handoff, which
 * is precisely the moment the measurement is about. Twelve minutes at 100 u/s
 * is 72,000 units, which is a perfectly ordinary double; the page draws it
